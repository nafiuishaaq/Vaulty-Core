# API Modules

The backend is organized into independent modules.

* Authentication
* Users
* Wallets
* Savings Vaults
* Transactions
* Banking
* Lending
* Borrowing
* Investments
* Rewards
* Notifications
* Analytics

Each module follows a layered architecture with controllers, services, repositories, and validation.

---

# Deployment Modes

The backend now supports separate API and worker deployment modes.

## API mode

Use this when you want the Express server and health endpoint.

```bash
docker compose up app
# or locally
npm run dev
```

## Worker mode

Use this when you want BullMQ workers to process background jobs such as notifications, streak calculations, emails, and payments.

```bash
docker compose up worker
# or locally
npm run dev -- --worker
```

## Health and readiness

The health endpoint reports the status of Prisma, Redis, and worker bootstrapping:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

A healthy deployment should report `ready: true` and `checks.workers.status: "ok"` when workers have been bootstrapped successfully.

---

# Authentication API

Base URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth`

## Register

Create a new user account.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/auth/register`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "phoneNumber": "+2348012345678"
}
```

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Registration successful. Please check your email to verify your account.",
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "clxxx",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "phoneNumber": "+2348012345678",
      "isEmailVerified": false,
      "role": "USER",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

**Validation:**
- Email must be valid and unique (stored trimmed + lowercased)
- Password must be at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number
- Phone number is optional; when provided it must be a valid Nigerian number and is stored in E.164 (`+234XXXXXXXXXX`)
- Verification links are delivered by email. Raw verification secrets are never returned in API responses.

---

## Identity Canonicalization

Auth identity fields are normalized before lookup and persistence so case, whitespace, and phone-format variants cannot create duplicate accounts.

| Field | Canonical form | Accepted input examples | Stored as |
|-------|----------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| `email` | Trim whitespace, lowercase | `User@Example.com`, ` user@example.com ` | `user@example.com` |
| `phoneNumber` | Nigerian E.164 | `08012345678`, `2348012345678`, `+2348012345678` | `+2348012345678` |

Normalization runs in:

- Zod auth validators (request transform)
- `AuthService` (defense in depth on register/login/forgot/resend)
- `UserRepository` find/create helpers

### Existing data

Apply the data migration to backfill rows created before this change:

```bash
npx prisma db execute --file prisma/sql/normalize_identity_fields.sql
```

The script lowercases emails, rewrites Nigerian phones to E.164, keeps the oldest row on collisions, tags newer email duplicates with `+dup.<id>`, and clears newer duplicate phone values.

## Login

Authenticate a user and receive tokens.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/auth/login`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",

---

# Running the Project

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 LTS
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Redis 7+
- Docker (optional, for containerized setup)

## Install dependencies

A `package-lock.json` is committed alongside `package.json`. Always use it for
reproducible installs:

```bash
# Reproducible install from lockfile (recommended — CI and Docker both use this)
npm ci

# Only run npm install if you are deliberately adding or updating a dependency,
# then commit the updated lockfile immediately.
npm install
```

## Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the environment variables with your database, Stellar, Redis, and third-party integration credentials.

### Configuration requirements by environment

- Development: local defaults are allowed for convenience, but the app still warns if values are malformed. Use `NODE_ENV=development` and the built-in localhost defaults if you are just running the service locally.
- Testnet: set `NODE_ENV=development` or `test`, `STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet`, `STELLAR_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org`, and provide real values for `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, and `CORS_ORIGIN`.
- Production: the app exits immediately if any required secret, URL, or infrastructure setting is missing, left at a localhost/default value, or set to a known insecure placeholder. `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` and `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` must be unique, non-placeholder values that are at least 32 characters long. `REDIS_PASSWORD` is required, `CORS_ORIGIN` must be explicit and cannot be `*`, and `STELLAR_NETWORK`/`STELLAR_HORIZON_URL` must match the intended network.

**Required environment variables:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_HOST` - Redis server host
- `REDIS_PORT` - Redis server port
- `REDIS_PASSWORD` - Redis authentication password (required in production)
- `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` - Secret for access token signing
- `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` - Secret for refresh token signing
- `CORS_ORIGIN` - Allowed CORS origins (comma-separated list; do not use `*` in production)
- `STELLAR_NETWORK` - Stellar network (testnet/mainnet)
- `STELLAR_HORIZON_URL` - Stellar Horizon server URL

## Database Setup

Generate Prisma client:

```bash
npm run prisma:generate
```

Run database migrations:

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate
```

To open Prisma Studio (database GUI):

```bash
npm run prisma:studio
```

## Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

## Build the project

```bash
npm run build
```

## Start production

```bash
npm start
```

## Docker Setup

Using Docker Compose (recommended for development):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The Dockerfile uses `npm ci` in both build and production stages, which requires
`package-lock.json` to be present and in sync with `package.json`. The lockfile
is committed to the repository — never delete or gitignore it.

This will start:
- The backend application on port 3000
- PostgreSQL on port 5432
- Redis on port 6379

To view logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f app
```

To stop services:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

# Testing

Run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Run integration tests:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

Run end-to-end tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

---

# Development Guidelines

* Use TypeScript throughout the project.
* Keep business logic inside services.
* Keep controllers lightweight.
* Validate all incoming requests.
* Write tests for new features.
* Follow RESTful API conventions.
* Document public endpoints.
* Handle errors consistently.
* Avoid hardcoded values; use configuration and environment variables.

---

# API Error Envelope

All error responses from the Vaulty Backend follow a standard JSON envelope format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description message"
}
```

In development environments (`NODE_ENV=development`), the response also includes the error stack trace:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description message",
  "stack": "Error stack trace..."
}
```

## Validation Errors

When a request payload fails validation, the response HTTP status code is `400 Bad Request` and includes a structured array of validation issues under the `errors` key:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": [
    {
      "path": ["email"],
      "message": "Invalid email address",
      "code": "invalid_format"
    },
    {
      "path": ["password"],
      "message": "Password must be at least 8 characters",
      "code": "too_small"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each validation error entry contains:
- `path`: An array of strings/numbers indicating the path to the invalid field (e.g., `["email"]`).
- `message`: A human-readable description of the validation failure.
- `code`: A stable, standardized error code representing the validation failure type (e.g., `invalid_type`, `invalid_format`, `too_small`, `too_big`).
