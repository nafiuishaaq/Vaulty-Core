# Vaulty Smart Contracts

The Vaulty smart contracts power the decentralized financial infrastructure of the platform. Built with **Soroban** on the **Stellar Network**, these contracts securely manage savings vaults, deposits, lending, borrowing, rewards, and user interactions in a transparent and trustless manner.

Each contract is designed to be modular, independently deployable, and easily auditable, allowing the protocol to evolve without affecting unrelated components.

# Overview

The smart contract layer is responsible for:

* Creating and managing savings vaults
* Locking and unlocking assets
* Processing deposits and withdrawals
* Tracking savings streaks
* Managing lending pools
* Processing collateralized loans
* Distributing rewards
* Recording on-chain financial activity
* Enforcing protocol rules

# Shared Modules

The `shared/` directory contains reusable logic across all contracts.

Includes:

* Custom errors with context
* Events for protocol actions
* Storage helpers
* Utility functions
* Shared data types
* Advanced fixed-point math
* Financial calculation utilities

This avoids duplication and keeps contracts consistent.

# Security Principles

Vaulty contracts are designed with security as a priority.

Key principles include:

* Explicit authorization checks
* Input validation
* Safe arithmetic with overflow protection
* Deterministic state transitions
* Event emission for important actions
* Modular architecture
* Minimal external dependencies

## Advanced Security Features

### Access Control
- Role-based permission system (Admin, Operator, User)
- Admin-only functions for critical operations
- Permission expiration support
- Granular access control per contract

### Rate Limiting
- Per-contract operation rate limits
- Configurable time windows
- Automatic counter reset
- Protection against spam attacks

### Emergency Controls
- Emergency stop functionality across all contracts
- Admin-triggered protocol pause
- Reason tracking for emergency stops
- Controlled recovery procedures

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive parameter validation
- Basis point validation for rates
- Lock period bounds checking
- Amount positivity checks

### Safe Arithmetic
- Checked arithmetic operations
- Overflow/underflow protection
- Fixed-point math for financial calculations
- Deterministic interest calculations

### Storage Safety
- Type-safe storage keys
- Persistent vs instance storage separation
- Proper initialization checks
- State consistency guarantees

# Events

Contracts emit events for major protocol actions.

Examples include:

* VaultCreated
* DepositMade
* WithdrawalCompleted
* VaultUnlocked
* StreakUpdated
* LoanIssued
* LoanRepaid
* RewardGranted

These events improve transparency and simplify frontend integrations.

---

# Testing

Each contract contains its own test suite.

Tests cover:

* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* Authorization checks
* Failure scenarios
* Edge cases
* State transitions

Run all tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

---

# Building Contracts

Compile all contracts to WASM:

```bash
# Using the build script (recommended)
./scripts/build.sh

# Or directly with cargo
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

The build script will:
- Compile all contracts in release mode
- Output WASM files to `target/wasm/`
- Copy each contract's `.wasm` file to a centralized location

---

# Formatting

Format source code:

```bash
cargo fmt
```

---

# Linting

Run Clippy:

```bash
cargo clippy
```

---

# Deployment

Contracts are deployed using the Stellar CLI.

## Environment Setup

Set the following environment variables before deploying:

```bash
export NETWORK=testnet  # or 'mainnet'
export SOURCE_ACCOUNT=your_stellar_address
export CONTRACTS_DIR=target/wasm
```

## Deployment Workflow

1. **Build contracts**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy to network**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy.sh
   ```
   This deploys all contracts and saves their IDs to `target/wasm/*_id.txt`

3. **Initialize contracts**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/initialize.sh
   ```
   This calls each contract's initialization entry point

4. **Verify deployment**
   ```bash
   # Check contract IDs
   cat target/wasm/vault_id.txt
   cat target/wasm/streaks_id.txt
   # etc.
   ```

5. **Connect frontend and backend services**
   - Use the deployed contract IDs in your application configuration

# Development Guidelines

When contributing:

* Keep contracts focused on a single responsibility.
* Reuse shared modules whenever possible.
* Write tests for all new functionality.
* Emit events for user-facing actions.
* Avoid breaking storage layouts without migration plans.
* Document all public functions.

---

# Roadmap

### Phase 1

# Vision

The Vaulty smart contracts form the trustless foundation of the platform, enabling users to securely save, grow, lend, borrow, and manage digital assets on Stellar. By keeping the contracts modular, secure, and transparent, Vaulty creates a scalable protocol that can evolve into a comprehensive decentralized wealth platform for users worldwide.
