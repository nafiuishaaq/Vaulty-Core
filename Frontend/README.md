# 🔐 Vaulty — Frontend

> **Save consistently. Grow your wealth. Unlock financial opportunities.**

This is the **web frontend** for Vaulty, a non-custodial decentralized savings platform built on the Stellar network. This package (`frontend/`) is the Next.js + React application that gives users a gamified, visually rewarding interface for saving, tracking streaks, earning yield, lending, borrowing, and investing — all while their funds remain in their own Stellar wallet.

This README covers the frontend workspace only. For contract and backend details, see the root repo README and the `contract/` and `backend/` workspace docs.

## What This App Does

The frontend is the primary surface where users experience Vaulty's core promise: saving money should feel engaging, not tedious. It is responsible for:

* Rendering savings vaults, goals, and lock periods
* Visualizing saving streaks and the GitHub-style savings calendar
* Triggering deposit celebration animations (vault pulse, confetti, milestone screens)
* Surfacing yield, lending, borrowing, and investment portfolio data
* Connecting to the user's Stellar wallet and initiating on-chain actions
* Driving the Nigerian bank deposit/withdrawal flow via the anchor partner integration (through the backend API)
* Displaying the Discipline Score and unlocked achievements
* Handling in-app notifications

The frontend never holds custody of funds and never talks to Soroban contracts with anything other than the user's own signed transactions — all fund movement is signed by the user's wallet.

### Feature Modules

* **`vaults/`** — Create, view, and manage savings vaults (Emergency Fund, School Fees, Rent, etc.). Displays target amount, progress, lock period, balance, deposit history, and maturity date.
* **`streaks/`** — Renders saving streaks (7/30/100/365-day), streak freezes, and the savings calendar showing daily deposits, missed days, and consistency.
* **`lending/`** — UI for supplying idle assets to the decentralized lending pool; shows active loans, expected returns, and loan maturity.
* **`borrowing/`** — UI for borrowing against a vault as collateral without breaking a savings streak.
* **`investments/`** — Portfolio allocation UI (Conservative / Balanced / Growth). Gated behind the regional legal review described in the root README before public launch.
* **`notifications/`** — In-app notification center for streak reminders, goal proximity alerts, and milestone congratulations.

## Key UI/UX Elements

* **Vault Pulse Animation** — plays on every successful deposit, alongside balance growth animation and progress updates
* **Milestone Celebrations** — confetti, animated vault, and celebration screens on achievements (First Deposit, $100 Saved, One Year Streak, etc.)
* **Savings Calendar** — GitHub-style contribution grid showing daily deposit activity
* **Discipline Score** — visual score display reflecting saving consistency, streak length, goal completion, repayment history, and investment activity
* **Smart Notifications** — contextual, encouraging copy (e.g. "You're only $15 away from your emergency fund goal.")

All animations exist to reinforce saving as a positive habit, not just to decorate the app — this is core to the product's differentiation from purely custodial competitors.

## Wallet & Chain Interaction

The frontend integrates with the Stellar network through:

* Wallet connection (Stellar-compatible wallets) via `src/lib/`
* Read calls to Soroban contracts for vault state, streak verification, and yield data
* User-signed transactions for deposits, withdrawals, lending, borrowing, and vault creation
* No private keys or signing authority ever touch the frontend's own state — all signing happens client-side via the connected wallet

Fiat-related flows (Nigerian bank deposit/withdrawal) are **not** handled directly by the frontend against the anchor partner — they go through the backend's `anchor-integration` module, which the frontend calls via its API client in `src/lib/`.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies (from the monorepo root, or inside frontend/ if standalone)
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Run the dev server
npm dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for required variables, which typically include:

* Stellar network config (testnet/mainnet horizon URL)
* Backend API base URL
* Wallet connector configuration
* Feature flags (e.g. enabling lending/borrowing/investments per phase)

## Development Notes

* This app currently targets **Phase 1–2** of the product roadmap (savings vaults, streaks, deposits, yield display, achievements, notifications). Lending, borrowing, and investment UIs exist as feature modules but should remain **gated/hidden** in production builds until Phase 3 (post-audit, post-legal-review) per the root README's roadmap.
* Yield, APY, and interest figures displayed in the UI should always be sourced from on-chain contract data (via `lib/`) rather than hardcoded or backend-cached values, to preserve the "verifiable on-chain" differentiator.
* Shared types between frontend and backend live in `src/types/` for now; if the API surface grows, these should move to a shared `packages/shared-types` workspace (see root README notes on repo structure).
